# Genetic-Algorithms-Project

## Objective:
To get familiar with the process of population evolution by using the inspirations of natural selection amongst a randomly generated initial population, and how it is applied to find solutions of modern problems.

## Implementation:
In this project, we were supposed to find the correct combination of logic gates in a logic design. This design gets 10 input signals (TRUE/FALSE). The first 2, feed the first logic gate, the output of this gate and the third input feed the second logic gate and so on, until the output of the last gate provides the output of the system. Thus, 9 logic gates should be determined from 6 possible choices for each of them: AND, OR, XOR, NAND, NOR, XNOR.  
We were provided with a truth table which determined the desired output for each combination of the 10 input signals (1024 possible combinations). The goal is to find the right combination 
## Results:

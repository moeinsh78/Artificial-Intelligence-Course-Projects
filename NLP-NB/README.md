## Objective: 
To classify user comments about some products to "Recommending" and "Non-Recommending" comments, using Naive Bayes classifier. 

## Implementation: 
Designed a system to estimate house prices based on their attributes. The system was trained by a dataset from Kaggle website
containing several houses prices and their features. For this purpose, the dataset was pre-processed and several machine learning models were
tested and their pros and cons were pointed out.

## Results: 
All of the results are aptly discussed in the [Jupyter Notebook File](https://github.com/moeinsh78/Artificial-Intelligence-Course-Projects/blob/master/NLP-NB/CA3.ipynb) and [HTML File](https://github.com/moeinsh78/Artificial-Intelligence-Course-Projects/blob/master/NLP-NB/CA3_Report.html)

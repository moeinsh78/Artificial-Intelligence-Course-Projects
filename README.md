# Artificial-Intelligence-Course-Projects

In this course, five different projects were conducted each of which concentrated on a particular concept of artificial intelligence. Their full description is available in the relative directory. Besides, a brief description of each project is included in the following:

### Neural Network: 
Designed a lung disease recognizer in shape of a 3-layer neural network, trained by images of sample lung CT Scan records. The
network had the ability of recognizing the disease showed by input CT Scan images and classifying them into 3 distinctive classes, each representing
a specific lung disease.

### Machine Learning: 
Designed a system to estimate house prices based on their attributes. The system was trained by a dataset from Kaggle website
containing several houses prices and their features. For this purpose, the dataset was pre-processed and several machine learning models were
tested and their pros and cons were pointed out.

### NLP-Naive Bayes: 
Designed a comment classifier able to detect positive and negative sentiment in users’ comments based on the conditional
probabilities calculated by ”Bag of Words” technique.

### Genetic Project: 
Solved a problem using genetically evolved solutions, in a reasonable amount of time. In this problem we were supposed to find
the right combination of six logic gates, matched with a given truth table.

### Search Project: 
Designed a game simulating snake moves in

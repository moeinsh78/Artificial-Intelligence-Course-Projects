# Search-Algorithms-Project

## Objective:
To design and compare the performance of informed and uninformed search algorithms such as BFS, IDS, A-star and Weighted A-star in a simulation of snake game.

## Implementation:
In this project, we simulated a snake game in which a snake with an initial body length of 1 was supposed to find the most efficient path to eat all the seeds in the game table. The game environment information -such as table dimensions, snake's initial location, seeds location and their score (can be 1 or 2 and seeds with 2 scores should be eaten twice)- is described by the user in the command line.
